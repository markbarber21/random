JS library need for sequencing
container based function sequencing to eliminate scoping
sequence.then(func1)
sequence.then(func2)

Every function has a callback to pull next.
Alternative jQuery deferred objects.

Native Javascript does not support this properly, and the need for libraries to fix this is the result.
I see a large group of JS individuals that are trying to overcome the language and develop a personal toolbox.

Don't use anonymous functions, or your stack is useless.
